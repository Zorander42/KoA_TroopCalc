# KoA_TroopCalc
Calculates march count for each tier of troop based on march capacity and custom ratios. Supports max tier of t7 and t8.


## Dependencies ##
Requires Ruby to be installed in order to run it. 
Ruby can be installed here: https://rubyinstaller.org/

If you only need it for this script, you may uncheck the box to install mysys (sp?) at the finish screen of the ruby installer.

## Alternative ##
Go to: https://repl.it/@Zorander421/KoATroopCalc
Hit run.
Respond to the prompt on the right as needed.
As far as I know, this will remain available. Feel free to save it your own account there too. (Not needed for use only)

## Download ##
Simply clone or download and extract the repository to the desired location.

## Usage ##
With ruby installed, it is as simple as double clicking on the script. 
You will see a command prompt, and you only need to follow the prompts and 
supply the corresponding information. 

## Credit ##
The ratios used are hardcoded at the top in a hash and may be changed if desired.
All credit goes to tiger38 for the values used. 

## Other Info ##
Not all possible errors are accounted for. Supply the march capacity prompt with only a whole number.
The tier prompt accepts t7, t8, T7, T8, 7, and 8 as valid input.
